Marvin Hertweck, Alassane Diagne

Numerical Optimization with Differential Equations 2, Project 2

Implementation of the Optimal Control problem posed in [this paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/oca.751) using Multiple shooting.

We do not take gear shifts into account to obtain a contrinous problem.
